Simple audio routing script.

Just root audio that's all, usefull if you are like me and use capture card for game console.

tested only on arch linux with pipewire and zenety

Depencies for gui version : sudo pacman -S pipewire wireplumber pipewire-alsa pipewire-pulse pipewire-jack alsa-utils zenity

or for cli version : sudo pacman -S pipewire wireplumber pipewire-alsa pipewire-pulse pipewire-jack alsa-utils

I'm really bad at this but it's usefull to me so maybe it wil be to you.

just do chmod +x "script name"  

and ./scriptname.sh
